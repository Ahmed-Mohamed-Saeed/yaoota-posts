## This is an explanation of how the app works
The home page includes all posts with pagination 20 per page. You can filter posts by title by typing in the search text field. The search is an auto search feature, so you don't have to click any buttons.

- On the home page, browse through the available posts.
- To view the details and comments of a post, click on the "View Post" button in the post card.
- On the post details page, you can view the content of the post as well as any existing comments.
- To add a comment, type your comment in the comment input field located at the bottom of the post details page. The comment input field is a multi-line input, so you can press enter to add multiple lines of text.
- Once you have entered your comment, click on the "Comment" icon to submit it.
Your comment will appear at the bottom of the page

To view all posts by a specific user or return to the home page, follow these steps:

- To check all posts by the user, click on the "CHECK POSTS" button located at the bottom of the post details page.
- This will take you to a page with all the posts made by the user, with pagination of 20 posts per page.
- To return to the home page and view all posts, click on the "Clear" icon located at the top right corner of the page.
This will  display all posts again on the home page.
